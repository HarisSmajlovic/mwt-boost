# MWTBoost - A set of heuristics for finding a minimum weight triangulation
MWTBoost provides a cross comparison of several metaheuristics all applied to the same problem of finding a [minimum-weight triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum-weight_triangulation) of a point set.

Metaheuristics applied:
- Hill climbing (first choice, greedy choice and random choice)
- Simulated annealing
- Particle swarm optimization
- Artificial bee colony algorithm

Aside from metaheuristics, an exhaustive search method is provided for finding all possible triangulations of a pointset.

# Testing
Comming "soon" ... (probably in my old days -- if we ever get there)
